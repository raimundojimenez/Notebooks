[Entity codes](https://sites.psu.edu/symbolcodes/codehtml/#math)    
[Greek symbols](https://www.keynotesupport.com/internet/special-characters-greek-letters-symbols.shtml)    

Once you have a preview of a symbol by using an html entity you can then simply copy and paste the rendered symbol without continuing to use the entity tag.

Jupyter notebooks are [MathJax aware](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Typesetting%20Equations.html#)

When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
